### Benefits of Aloe Vera

This miracle plant is one of the oldest known medicinal plants, with a legacy reaching as far back as Cleopatra. The gel that fills every leaf has been proven to accelerate healing and soothe enflamed or tired skin. Aloe actively helps skin to repair by naturally stimulating cell production and increasing collagen. The gel also contains elastin fiber which, working alongside collagen, firms the skin’s matrix, toning and smoothing its appearance. Aloe’s natural balance of essential minerals and vitamins enhance its moisturizing, cleansing, and soothing qualities.
