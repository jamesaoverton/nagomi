## The Facial Massage

This special massage stimulates the lymph glands in the face, removing toxins and excess fluids.
Removing these toxins gives you healthy, glowing skin.  This massage also helps to replenish moisture and remove the top layer of dead skin cells, which will help to even out skin tone.

Another benefit of this facial massage is it stimulates collagen production which fills in wrinkles and smooths out the face.

Also, bad circulation makes your face seem puffy and pale.  Massaging around your mouth, eyes and eyebrows will increase the circulation and take away puffiness to brighten your skin.

Lastly, this facial massage will help you relax, de-stress and eliminate headaches by focusing on pressure points.

Overall, it reduces wrinkles, lifts the face, prevents and improves sagging skin, reduces pore size and will get rid of puffy eyes and under-eye bags.

This cosmetic treatment is said to help make skin look younger, smoother, and all-around healthier NATURALLY.

On the face, the acupuncturist inserts tiny and painless needles (Thin as a hair). As these needles puncture the skin, they create wounds within its threshold, which are called positive microtraumas. 

When your body senses these wounds, it goes into repair mode.
These punctures stimulate your lymphatic and circulatory system, which work together to deliver nutrients and oxygen to your skin cells, nourishing skin from the inside out. 

This helps even out your complexion and promote your skin’s glow. The positive microtraumas also stimulate the production of collagen. This helps improve elasticity, minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.

The effects of Facial Acupuncture are cumulative and last up to 3-5 years after a course of 10 treatments, with maintenance.  We do have a great package plan for 6, 10, and 15 treatments.

Please call or [email](mailto:info@nagomi.ca) for an appointment or if have any questions or concerns!
