After immigrating to Canada, he studied traditional Chinese medicine and eventually became a practitioner. 

At Nagomi, his focus is to bring the ultimate health and wellness to his patients through Traditional Chinese Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine etc.). He can a wide variety of ailments from general malaise to specific illnesses. His experience as a medical doctor in Japan as well as a Chinese medicinal practitioner helps to understand the patient's condition better. His attention to detail and dedication to his work make him an asset to us. He’s very excited to be joining the team here at Nagomi and can't wait to make people's lives better one patient at a time.
